Thanks
-----

I would like to thanks all the work from all the contributors on AlsaModularSynth,
especially:
 Matthias Nagorni <mana@suse.de>
 Fons Adriaensen <adriaena@users.sourceforge.net>
 Karsten Wiese <fzu@users.sourceforge.net>
 Malte Steiner <steiner@block4.com>
 Guido Scholz <guido.scholz@bayernline.de>

Without their work on AMS, these plugins wouldn't have existed.

A great thanks as well to the authors of LV2, especially:
 David Robillard <d@drobilla.net>
who guided me in this work.

A greath thanks to Florent Berthaut <florent@hitmuri.net> for Tranches:
